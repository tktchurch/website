## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please refrain from logging it as a public issue and instead send us a confidential report. Here's how you can reach us:

- Send an email to [security@tktchurch.org](mailto:security@tktchurch.org)
- Expect a reply within 48 hours confirming receipt of your message
- We'll investigate the issue and strive to keep you informed about our progress towards resolving it
- We'll aim to promptly fix the issue and engage with you for coordinating public disclosure

### Tips for Reporting

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and scope of the vulnerability. This should include:

- Detailed steps to reproduce the issue or a proof of concept
- Your view on the impact and severity of the issue

Thank you for helping us ensure the security and privacy of our users.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the tktchurch security team and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. We believe that public disclosure of vulnerabilities with a practical mitigation in place is in the best interest of user security.

Please refrain from sharing your report with others until we've had a chance to diagnose and offer a resolution.

## Policy Adherence

Failure to comply with this policy may result in suspension of your access to our resources, which we may lift once we've had a chance to review your compliance with our policies.

Thank you for helping keep the tktchurch/website and its users safe!
